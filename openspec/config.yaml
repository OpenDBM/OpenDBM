  Tech: Tauri 2 + React 19 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite
  UI: Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui style
  Components: src/components/ui/* (shadcn), use cn() from @/lib/utils for className merging
  Rust: Commands in lib.rs with #[tauri::command], register in generate_handler![]
  Conventions: @/* aliases, no CSS prefix, lucide-react icons
  Language Requirement: All documentation, specifications, plans, and reasoning MUST be written in **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**. Do NOT use English for explanations unless it is a specific technical term that is untranslatable. Code Exception: Variable names, function names, and file paths must remain in **English**.
  
rules:
  specs:
    - Use Given/When/Then format for behavior scenarios
    - Specify Tauri command signatures (Rust fn + TS invoke type)
    - Include error handling paths for Rust commands
  
  tasks:
    - Tag as [frontend], [backend], or [infra]
    - Break into ≤2hr chunks
    - Note Tauri-specific steps (update invoke_handler, rebuild)
  
  proposals:
    - Separate frontend/backend changes with horizontal rules
    - Flag breaking changes to Rust command signatures
    - Consider both dev (vite) and production (tauri build) impact
