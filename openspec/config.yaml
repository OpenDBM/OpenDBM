context: |
  Stack: Tauri 2 + React 19 + TypeScript + Go (Unified Backend)
  UI: Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui (New York style), premium aesthetics (micro-animations, OKLCH colors)
  React 19: Use React.ComponentRef (avoid ElementRef), strict typing
  Conventions: @/* aliases, cn() for merging, cva() for variants, Lucide icons
  Back-end: Go + GORM (Raw SQL preferred), REST/WebSocket for Tauri communication
  Local: All technical plans (implementation_plan.md) and reasoning MUST be in Simplified Chinese. English for code only.

rules:
  specs:
    - Describe behavior using Given/When/Then scenarios
    - Define API contracts (Endpoint, Method, Request/Response schemas)
    - Include error handling and validation logic
  
  implementation_plan:
    - Group by component (Backend/Go vs Frontend/React)
    - Separated by horizontal rules (---)
    - Use render_diffs() for existing file modifications
    - Use [NEW] and [DELETE] for file lifecycle changes
    
  walkthrough:
    - Include ![Summary](path/to/recording.webp) for UI changes
    - List technical debt addressed (e.g. deprecation fixes)
    - Explicitly state build verification results (e.g. tsc status)
